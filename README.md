# AI-Story-Teller-React-App
A simple React web app that uses the OpenAI API to generate a story blurb based on user input!

The working app can be accessed by browser here: https://ai-story-teller-react-app.vercel.app

Note: Hosting on Vercel (as opposed to GitHub Pages) allows me to easily deploy the web app while still using my personal API key because Vercel will encrypt it :)
